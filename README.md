# Mad Lib Functions
Created as part of Codecademy's Learn PHP course.

## Description
In this project, weâ€™ll use PHP to write a function to fill in a Mad Libs story! Mad Libs are short stories with blank spaces, which get filled in by the user. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:

    A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
    Words to fill in those blanks.
For this project, we provide the story, but it will be up to you to create a function that:

    Takes desired words as arguments.
    Returns the story with the words put into blanks in the right place.
